    The name LimKnow is derived from two words, 'Lim' is from Limnology and 'Know' stands for Knowledge. LimKnow provides information about Wetland Biodiversity and Health 
    in the city of Guwahati and is built on the philosophy of 'Think locally and act locally'. It engages users through Augmented Reality (AR) and interactive learning.
    Through this app, we are attempting to create a local community of informed and involved citizens for lake monitoring and management. 
    It is used for crowdsourcing wetland data for research.

Features : 
1. Macrophyte identification keys
2. Learning about wetland species through AR Experience
3. Wetland surveys
4. Lake Health and Invasive Species Reporting

The pilot study of the app is on Deepor Beel. In future, we plan to extend the app for all wetlands of Guwahati.
